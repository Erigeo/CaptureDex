        <p>Welcome! This is CaptureDex, a pokédex focused on your personal progress of pokémon capturing.</p>

        <p>In CaptureDex, you can mark and see which pokémon you've captured. You can also them filter by game!</p>
        <p>This way, it's easier to see which pokémon are missing for one game (and in general).</p>

        <p>Let's capture them all!</p>
